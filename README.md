### 👾 About Me

I’m the shadow lurking in your system’s blind spots.  
I find what others can’t see — and exploit what others ignore.

### ⚠️ WARNING

This space is not for the faint-hearted.  
Any unauthorized access, probing, or tampering will be met with swift retaliation.  
You’ve been warned.

### 🚨 Final Word

Play smart or get out.  
I don’t chase trouble, but I’m always ready to handle it.

**Consider this your last warning.**
